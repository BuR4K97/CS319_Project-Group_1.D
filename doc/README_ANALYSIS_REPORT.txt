In case of unreadabilty of diagrams, here are the some links of diagrams:

https://github.com/BuR4K97/CS319_Project-Group_1.D/blob/unstable/doc/UpdatedClassSilikli.jpg

Other Diagrams seems readable so we didn't attached any links for them. But again, their screenshot available 
under unstable branch and doc file with their corresponding names.
