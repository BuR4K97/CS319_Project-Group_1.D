-Object Oriented Programming(Risk Board Game)

-Brief description of your project topic(the real one):
  
  Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players. The standard version is played on a board  depicting a political map of Earth, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents. Turn rotates among players who control armies of playing pieces with which they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls. Players may form and dissolve alliances during the course of the game. The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the board and in doing so, eliminate the other players. The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to multiple days to finish. European versions are structured so that each player has a limited "secret mission" objective that shortens the game.

-Brief description of what you will do, your requirements:

 The digital version of the game will be implemented by using object oriented software programming.
 Deciding on how we are going to implement and add some features such as visual effects, specific theme and etc.
 
-What are the differences between your project and the real one, in short?
  The map of the game in our project will be different than the original one. Unit types will be changed (there will be some special types of units as hereos with different power sets and different abilities). Since defenders can roll at most two dice, where attackers roll three dice, we might make some changes in the favor of defense, in order to fix imbalance, and so on.
